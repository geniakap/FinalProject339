            <h1>About</h1>
            <!-- image -->
            <p>I am a current junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a Bachelor of Science in UX Design, with a minor in art & design, looking to develop my creative skills and enter the design industry post graduation. I have been involved in the arts for my entire life, but became fascinated by the unique ways that design is relevant to nearly all facets of human life late in my high school career and decided to pursue this in my higher education. I have a background in fine arts, especially drawing and painting, but have expanded my skills to 3D work, animation and printmaking, among others, in my time here at Michigan.</p>
